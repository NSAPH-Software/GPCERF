Resubmission (April 11, 2024)

We appreciate your efforts in reviewing the GPCERF 0.2.4 package. In this upgrade, we:

- Referred to the arXiv e-print via its DOI directly.
- Removed the URI to CONTRIBUTING.md in README.md.

Regarding the other two notes:

- Rcpp cannot be removed from LinkingTo as it will cause compilation error.

All tests and checks have passed successfully.

Best regards,
Boyu Ren
